# Isomorphic-Tree-Visualizer
üå≤ Final Project for CS2309: Problem Solving and Practice üå≤ 

## Introduction
This visualizer can read from two txt files and create two trees.
It can also judge whether the two trees are isomorphic. If so, when you click on one node, both the node and the isomorphic node on the other tree will be highlighted.
An example is as below.

## Compile
This project is based on c++ FLTK library. To compile it, you have to install FLTK. And if you are using Windows, MSYS2 is recommended.

## Result
Here is the result of the visualizer.

‚ö†Ô∏è If the tree is too large, several nodes may be overlapped.
